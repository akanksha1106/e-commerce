# README — E-Commerce SQL Analytics Project
# What I Built

I built an E-Commerce Sales Analysis System using SQL.
The project involves creating a structured database to manage online sales information — including customers, products, orders, and payments.
Using SQL queries, I analyzed the data to find top customers, best-selling products, and monthly sales trends.
This helps demonstrate how structured data and analytical queries can generate valuable business insights.

# Why I Built It

I built this project to understand how SQL can be used for data analytics and decision-making in real-world business scenarios.
By analyzing e-commerce sales data, I learned how companies use databases to:

Track and improve customer engagement

Identify profitable products

Understand sales patterns over time

This project also helped strengthen my understanding of database design, joins, aggregations, and data interpretation.

# How I Built It

Database Design:
Created four main tables — Customers, Products, Orders, and Payments — with proper primary and foreign key relationships.

Data Insertion:
Inserted realistic sample records for customers, products, and transactions to simulate real e-commerce operations.

Query Development:
Wrote SQL queries to calculate total revenue, top customers, product performance, and monthly sales trends.

Insight Generation:
Analyzed query results and summarized key findings in a formatted PDF report to highlight how data-driven insights help businesses.
